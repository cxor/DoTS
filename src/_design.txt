class Simulation
class Navigator
class Map
class Waypoint
class Node
class Sink

* Simulation -> runs different 3 kind of simulations
    * Healthy network, i.e. no faults
    * Stressed network, i.e. random failure
    * Disaster, i.e temporary black out of communications

    * Disaster requires modification to Map, and to Navigator capabilities

* Navigator -> builds paths for nodes
    * reverts the path whenever the node enters a disastered zone
    

    * message rate -> opportunistic [DONE]
    * buffer is full -> drop the last 10% of messages [TODO]
    * metasimulations -> keep splitted [DONE]
    * store stats to plot overlapping charts [TODO]
    * fault -> unique value for both nodes and sinks [DONE]
